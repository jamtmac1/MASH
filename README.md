# MASH
Mansion Apartment Shack House


A childhood favorite schoolyard game. If you couldn't build a fortunate teller out of paper, you just did this instead.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Even though I recently found my passion project, I did not have one when I started this programming journey. This game randomly came to mind one day and I decided I wanted to give it a go. Still a work in progress but I needed the basis of this to help me hone in my skills. JavaScript has not exactly been a breeze. I am trying to get better at the theory and the 'why' behind it. That will help me to think outside the box more. Clearly I am not the best designer which may be a shock since I am a fashion designer, but it's not because I can't. I just could care less about the look and feel right now, and I am more concerned with nailed the code that powers the app. I will at some point spice up the CSS. I didn't want to go completely plain on design though, I went with a famous rap pen and pixel cover. This is nostalgic 90's just like this game. 

The idea of the game, for people that have not played, is to select four options in each category and then let the randomizer select your future. MASH stands for mansion, apartment, shack, or house. One of those will be selected by default, but you can see the theme is to have options of various scales. So to start you will select your love interests. Ideally you would select someone like your dream partner, a nightmare partner, a funny partner, and a random partner. That is what makes the game fun. The fact that you can randomly have a crap or enjoyable laugh. On my first test run I was able to get my current fiance as my partner, my current apartment, my current car, $15/hr job, SWE career, and a cat for a pet. So the fortune is pretty accurate!



Lessons Learned:
CSS is still a pain but I will get this looking saucy. I need to practice methods more. I was able to google and search githubs and codepens for some additional code. My next goal is to center the "alerts" and style.
